I started in the early 80s, initially with Basic, but my interests have gone through a number of changes over the years.  Today I'm into Python (and Django), Vim and Linux.  I enjoy math.  I'm also interested in Birds and birding, and various areas of Ecology.  I have an interest in combining my interests in math (and stats), programming and biology to do some kind of modeling projects.</p>
<p>I work in tourism in Namibia, and do guide training, but I'd like to move to the UK in the coming months or years and see if I can peruse a career in programming.</p>

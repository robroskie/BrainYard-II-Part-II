<p>1) Psychology - particularly psychoanalysis, group dynamics and psychology of masses
2) Philosophy - Mostly interested in practical aspects, such as dialectical logic
3) Personal Development - Some might not classify it as a separate field of study, but I have spent more than 10 years doing research and consulting in this area and I know how deep and fascinating this field is. 
4) Business Management - Systems and Control theory. Spent a lot of time working on startups as well. 
5) Education - Tought Machine Learning, Algorithms and Data Structures and Engineering Design classes to undergraduate students in Qafqaz University. 
6) Gaming - I have played lots of games, and I have studied them as well. I believe that we can borrow a lot of tricks from successful games, especially in the area of motivation, and implement them in education and other areas. </p>

<p>As for computer science itself, my main focus is Machine Learning, Multi-Agent Systems and Crowdsourcing. </p>

<p>It might seem that all these subjects are completely unrelated, but they are all united in the goal to understand various aspects of human mind: how we think, how we learn, how we motivate ourselves, etc. </p>

<p>This is what excites me most. I think that to make the world a better place, we should start with understanding and improving ourselves.</p>

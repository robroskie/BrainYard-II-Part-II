Variables which cannot discriminate between outcomes will not be selected for tree splitting.  The xgb.plot.importance() function in the xgboost R library plots feature importance as a bar graph.

1188772,2009-08-29 22:09:52.913,1350694,0,I can't prove it but the difference looks like O(log(n)) vs. O(n)  or even worse. The overhead of creating and populating temporary table is negligible for larger n (n>5). Originally we introduced this to overcome performance problems with IN operator with large number of elements. After adding convenience methods that made usage transparent and concise we never looked back at using IN again (in cases when number of elements varies).,59470
1188775,2009-08-29 22:11:23.860,1350694,0,Just quick performance comment: by replacing IN with temporary table you essentially replace OR operator with inner join. Any DBA would agree that performance gain from this is enormous.,59470
1189559,2009-08-30 06:05:30.427,1352716,0,You contradict yourself - there is special value - self - for parent rows in the example of the function given. The fact that it accounts for nulls doesn't prove that it's a good practice to use it that way. The fact that some use it doesn't make it best practice either. Goto statement used to be common but people realized to stay away from it eventually. Given choices best practice would be non-null special value. Simple argument against null I already made is that it always requires special extra check like in the function from your example.,59470

The reason of this not working on italian pages is that the page is assigning a class 'current' to the ' <li>' elements.

I see that you have got the idea and as you correctly mentioned - just sit and take a look at the code (specially how the values are getting assigned/stored and the checks you have in place in your JS code). That should take care of all these issues.

27495192,2013-09-07 01:56:31.677,18666749,0,Hi Rohit. Can you explain more what you mean when you say Facebook.HttpMethod.GET doesn't exist? Can you put an example project somewhere I can take a look at it? (e.g. github),74837
27496841,2013-09-07 05:03:37.687,18618787,1,"Hi Rohit, can you show me the call you're making too? Your response looks like binary data, are you getting the profile picture for example?  the FB.API call doesn't currently support anything but a string result, we're working on a solution though. (if you have a code project you'd like to point me at I'd be glad to take a look)",74837
27497842,2013-09-07 06:32:31.040,18669084,1,"Android has a uri as well, call getActivity().getIntent().getData() and it returns a Uri. you can then say intentUri.getQueryParameter(""request_ids""); to get the request ids if it was started this way. (we don't support this directly in the FB Unity SDK. I don't think this is a common use case and wanted to keep things simple)",74837
27497979,2013-09-07 06:44:04.993,18669084,1,For your second question: I'm afraid we don't have subscriptions for app requests. but since they have to originate from within your own game you have the opportunity to implement your own push approach if you have a backend set up to do this (e.g. Parse let's you implement an afterSave function if that's what you're looking for).,74837
27498165,2013-09-07 07:01:20.903,18669084,1,"I'm afraid so, I'm sorry for your frustration. My biggest goal for the Unity SDK is simplicity, and fetching all requests and showing them to the user in a game specific way seems to be the approach most developers have taken. That said, you're not the first person to ask for this, so I'm open to adding it. In the meantime something like this in your C# might work: AndroidJavaClass jc = new AndroidJavaClass(""com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer""); AndroidJavaObject jo = jc.GetStatic(""currentActivity""); jo.Call(""getData"",...); Not too tough, I hope, and sorry, again, for the frustration.",74837
